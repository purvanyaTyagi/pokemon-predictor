# pokemon-predictor
a simple pokemon type1 predictor

this includes all the data preprocessing and the model including a tensorflow version

In this project i have used a pokemon dataset containing their ability (speed, strength etc) 
And it's type(fire, grass etc) 

In this project I trained a deep neural network on the pokemon dataset available on kaggle. 

I'll also build a web app for this
